    <h1>Refund and Return Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 25, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 26, 2025</p>

    <p>At PatientLead Health LLC, we want you to understand how refunds, returns, and cancellations work for all PatientLead+ subscription plans.</p>

    <h2>Free trials</h2>
    <p>Eligible plans include a free trial period. If you cancel before the trial ends, you will not be charged.</p>

    <h2>No refunds after billing starts</h2>
    <p>All subscription payments are non-refundable once the billing period begins.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you cancel in the middle of a billing period, your subscription remains active until the end of the period you paid for.</li>
      <li>We do not issue partial or prorated refunds for unused time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    <p>We will issue refunds under these circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Duplicate charges caused by billing errors.</li>
      <li>Incorrect billing amounts due to technical issues.</li>
      <li>Where required by law, including applicable consumer protection regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to cancel</h2>
    <p>You can cancel at any time through your account settings. Your subscription will stay active until the end of the paid period, and no future payments will be collected.</p>
